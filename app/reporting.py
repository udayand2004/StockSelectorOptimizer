        As a quantitative analyst reviewing a new strategy for an internal team presentation, provide a constructive and objective evaluation of the following backtest report. The goal is to analyze the current results and identify key areas for refinement. Maintain a professional, forward-looking tone.

        **Key Performance Indicators:**
        {kpi_summary}

        **Yearly Returns (%):**
        {yearly_summary}
        
        **Activity Log Summary:**
        - The strategy was invested in the market for approximately {time_in_market_pct:.0f}% of the rebalancing periods ({active_months} out of {total_months}).

        **Your evaluation should be structured as follows:**

        1.  **Performance Summary:**
            - Objectively state the strategy's CAGR and Sharpe Ratio from the report.
            - Briefly comment on the relationship between the absolute return (CAGR) and the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).

        2.  **Risk & Volatility Profile:**
            - Discuss the observed Max Drawdown. What does this metric suggest about the strategy's risk during the backtest period?
            - Comment on the reported Beta. What does a Beta of {kpis.get('Beta', 0):.2f} imply about the strategy's correlation to the market based on these results?

        3.  **Strategy Behavior & Regime Filter:**
            - Analyze the yearly returns for patterns or consistency.
            - Based on the activity log ({time_in_market_pct:.0f}% time in market), comment on the behavior of the market regime filter. How did it influence the strategy's exposure during this specific historical period?

        4.  **Observations & Key Areas for Improvement:**
            - Based on the analysis, what are the most important observations?
            - Point out any inconsistencies between different metrics (e.g., between CAGR and yearly returns, or Beta and strategy type) as areas for further validation in the backtesting engine.
            - Suggest clear, actionable next steps for the team. Frame these as refinements rather than failures. For example:
                - "Refine the regime filter to potentially improve market entry/exit timing."
                - "Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the model's features."
                - "Validate the calculation of key metrics like Beta and CAGR in the backtesting module to ensure they align with portfolio activity."
                - "Incorporate a benchmark comparison (e.g., NIFTY 50) in future reports to better quantify alpha."

        5.  **Overall Conclusion:**
            - Provide a brief, forward-looking summary. Conclude that this backtest provides a valuable baseline and highlights specific areas for development to enhance the strategy's performance and robustness.
